      <h1>Why? Rationale</h1>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>School Computers are Locked Down - Cannot Install Apps and/or Cannot Use Bluetooth BLE!</li>
          <li>Students Already Use ReplIt.com - Why Teach Students Another IDE if ReplIt.com can Work! <Too!></Too!></li>
          <li>Chromebooks with Java and Python - I'm a Professional Developer that Uses a Chromebook!
          </li>
          <li>Real Python Instead of Brython - Want to Combine Finch with Other Python Modules You Teach!</li>
          <li>Fully Asynchronous and Raw Power - Control Multiple Finch at Same Time and Have No Limits!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Seriously - all of these are true. My school computers are locked down and I do use ReplIt because it just works for all students on any computer. And yes, even bluetooth is locked down - and I tried the usb dongle and there is no way around it. So my students can develop on the school computer in ReplIt just as they always do, and they can see the results without a working Finch realtime. Then when they are ready they can use their phone or personal computer that does support bluetooth to connect to an actual Finch.
        </p>
        <p>
        And the power is really significantly greater which is a big deal for AP high school students. They can start with one or more Finch in the "main" code file, but they don't take long to realize that is very limiting. Now they can code each Finch in a separate code file and have them work fully asynchronously and independent of each other without worrying about threading. And while some students like the turtle-like Finch movements, some prefer the Finch buzzer - so why not let them make real music that runs separately too.
